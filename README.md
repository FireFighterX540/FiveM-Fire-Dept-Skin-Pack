Files included are .PNG and PSD so you can edit them yourself!

Each skin has multiple unit numbers, open the .psd and remove the number if you donâ€™t want it

I forgot to mention that the fire truck and the ambulance in the vehicle pack replaces the in game ones, so these will spawn instead of stock ones
